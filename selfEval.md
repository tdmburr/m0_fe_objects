# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

Over-analyzing things. Took some time to find easier answers to my problems.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I've taken notes for every section of mod 0. Some are better than others. Writing down examples and context has helped out. I was taking the best notes during demonstrations.

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I definitely lean in to googling after trying to find a solution from the information that I presently know.
